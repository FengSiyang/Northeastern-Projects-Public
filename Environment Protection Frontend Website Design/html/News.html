                        </div>
                        <p>Scientists know that certain gases trap heat and act like a blanket to warm the planet. One of the most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), which we release into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels — oil, coal, and natural gas — to generate electricity, power our vehicles, and heat our homes.</p>

                        <p>Trends in temperature readings from around the world show that global warming is taking place. <br>
                            Every one of the past 40 years has been warmer than the 20th century average. 2016 was the hottest year on record. The 12 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998. <br>
                            Over the past 130 years, the global average temperature has increased 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit, with more than half of that increase occurring over only the past 35 years.</p>
                        <p>Global warming has serious implications for our health, environment, and economy. Dangerous heat waves are increasing in severity and frequency. Sea level rise is accelerating. Extreme rainfall are on the rise in some areas. More severe droughts are occurring in others. Collectively, these effects pose a threat to the entire planet — including you, your community, and your family.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In 2013, the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council (EASAC), a group of 27 national science academies in Europe, released a study titled “Trends in Extreme Weather Events in Europe.” This week, EASAC shared an update to that study that incorporates data from 2013 through 2017.</p>
                        <p>The extreme weather events were happening much more frequently across the globe. The data between 2013 and 2017 indicate that they’re not likely to get less frequent anytime soon.</p>
